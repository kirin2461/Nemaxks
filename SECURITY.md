# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, do not open a public issue.

Instead, contact the repository owner privately and include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact
- Suggested fix (if available)

## Moderation & access
This project is designed to support server-side moderation and administrative access (with auditing) and therefore does not implement end-to-end encryption for chats.
